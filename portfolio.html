                <p class="aggielabinfo">My research experience is with AGGIES Lab. I currently have a 
                    published paper pending with the International Conference on AI Research (ICAIR) titled 
                    Cracking the Chip: AI-Powered Security for Semiconductor Threats. It proposes a comprehensive threat model of the 
                    semiconductor supply chain, with an aim to mitigate threats at each major step using AI-driven methods. 
                    Currently, my research now focuses on creating an actual end product known as a Netlist Inspection Tool, 
                    which analyzes netlists generated to design semiconductors. This is to target Hardware Trojan threats that can 
                    occur at any point in the design process.

                    real-time updates for the humidity and temperature of your plant's environment. This was built using a Raspberry Pi Pico, a humidity sensor, and a servo motor.
                    The system will automatically open a valve to water the plants if the moisture falls beneath a set threshold level. <a class ="hlink" href="https://devpost.com/software/hackplant">More About HackPlant</a>

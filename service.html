                <p class = "txinfo">The Texas Science and Engineering Fair occurs every year and is hosted at Texas A&M. 
                    I had the opportunity to volunteer for two days that were full of exciting moments. 
                    The first day involved activities for the contestants, and gave them a pathway to further enriching their experience in the 
                    STEM field. I helped with setting up Zachry for the evening, distributed t-shirts to the contestants, and helped oversee the
                    smooth running of the event. I not only had the chance to connect with young minds who are already contributing inspiring ideas 
                    to all fields of engineering and science, but I was also able to have insightful discussions with fellow students and professional 
                    volunteers who came to curate a wonderful experience for everyone involved. Learn more at <a href="https://txsef.tamu.edu/">TXSEF @ TAMU</a>

            <p class = gisinfo>As a member of Girls in STEM, an organization from my high school that focused on opportunities for female students in all STEM fields, 
                I volunteered for Science Night. This was an evening focused on educating elementary school students in my district on a variety of different 
                scientific fields. There were numerous interactive activities and demonstrations to help enrich their understanding of what it means to be in STEM. 
                I was also the head coordinator for another organization I was part of, National Art Honor Society, who volunteered to custom tie-dye shirts for 
                over 500 students. The ability to understand firsthand the impact this night had on exciting kids for learning more about STEM was a wonderful 
                experience, and I’m glad I was able to do so for two years straight.

            <p class = "bigeventinfo">
                Big Event occurs every year at TAMU, where hundreds of students come together to give back to the community around us. 
                I had the privilege of volunteering with Engineering Honors, and got to help clean up two trailers and the shed of a Bryan resident. 
                One forgettable moment of this experience was being able to connect with people outside of the classroom, and especially with those who 
                live in the BCS area but are not students themselves. Get to know more at <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">The Big Event</a>!
